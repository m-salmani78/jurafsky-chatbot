He mentioned: in many spaces, women\\'s role-playing is empty and women\\'s talent, creativity, initiative and innovation can be used a lot.[126][127]\\nRaisi stated: \"The intellectual of the society understands before the others and watches the threats of the society and soon warns the society with his poetry and art and saves the society from falling asleep like a muezzin\"; According to him, supporting the people of culture and art should not be verbal and should lead to action.[128] In addition,\\nformer Head of Management and Planning Organization Farhad Rahbar was appointed as the President\\'s Assistant for Economic Affairs.[88] Amir-Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi was appointed as a Vice President and the Head of the Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs on 12 September.[89]\\nImportation of COVID-19 vaccine meanwhile surged since Raisi took office, with over 30 million doses being imported during the Iranian month of Shahrivar, more than the vaccine imports since February 2021, while 13.4 million were imported during the month of Mordad in which Raisi was sworn in. During the meeting, the two countries signed 20 cooperation agreements and agreed to boost relations.[103] Following the talks, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties cut in 2016 on 10 March after a deal brokered between the two countries by China following secret talks in Beijing.[104]\\nRaisi condemned Israel\\'s actions in the Gaza Strip during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza \"with the support of the United States and certain European countries.', metadata={'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi'})]"
